Solar Power Quality (PQ) and Predictive Maintenance (PM) DashboardThis project is an AI-powered health monitoring dashboard for small-scale rooftop solar PV systems, built using Streamlit. It focuses on maintaining system efficiency and safety by continuously analyzing power quality metrics, adhering strictly to IEEE 519 standards for harmonic distortion, and providing Remaining Useful Life () prognostics for critical components.The application allows users to simulate real-time sensor data and instantly view diagnostics for potential failures, enabling a shift from reactive to proactive maintenance.Key FeaturesThe dashboard provides a unified view of system health, categorized into three main components:1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)Immediate Diagnostics: Analyzes instantaneous power quality data (, , ) to classify immediate fault conditions, such as System Resonance or Harmonic Distortion.Actionable Intelligence: Provides a specific, recommended action and an associated priority level (Urgent, High, Medium) for any detected fault.2. Predictive Maintenance (PM) & RULThis core feature uses trend analysis to predict when a component is likely to fail or breach a safety threshold.VTHD RUL: Predicts the time (in days) until Voltage THD exceeds the IEEE 519 limit of 5.0%, indicating a severe safety and stability risk.ITHD RUL: Predicts the time until Current THD exceeds a conservative component health limit (), preventing premature inverter filter failure.Power Factor RUL: Predicts the time until the Power Factor drops below the utility penalty threshold (), helping avoid unnecessary operational costs.3. Standards ComplianceAll RUL calculations and thresholds are aligned with the best practices derived from IEEE 519 and common utility requirements for  system interconnection.Core TechnologiesFrontend: Streamlit (for interactive dashboard)Backend/Logic: PythonData Handling: NumPy and pandasPersistence: joblib (for model placeholders/serialization)Installation and SetupPrerequisitesYou need Python 3.8+ installed on your system.Clone the repository:git clone [https://github.comcom/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.comcom/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
Create a virtual environment (Recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:pip install streamlit pandas numpy joblib
Usage1. Running the Dashboard (Live Analysis)To launch the interactive dashboard, run the main file:streamlit run pq_pm_dashboard.py
The application will open in your browser, allowing you to manipulate the input sliders for Instantaneous and Trend Average data to simulate different fault scenarios and observe the immediate  and the  predictions.2. Setting up Automated Email AlertsThe predictive capability is designed to trigger automated emails when a  crosses a critical time threshold (e.g., less than 14 days to failure). This requires running a separate script, alert_scheduler.py, outside of the Streamlit application.2.1 ConfigurationBefore running, you MUST update the following variables in the alert_scheduler.py script:VariableDescriptionSENDER_EMAILThe email address used to send the alerts.SENDER_PASSWORDThe App Password for the sender account (required for services like Gmail).RECEIVER_EMAILThe maintenance or operations recipient email address.2.2 Execution (Scheduling)You should schedule alert_scheduler.py to run periodically (e.g., every 30 minutes or hourly) using a system utility:Linux/macOS (using cron):# Example: Run every hour
0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/alert_scheduler.py
Windows: Use the Task Scheduler to set the Python script to run on a recurring schedule.Project Structure├── .
